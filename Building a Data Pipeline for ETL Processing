Project Idea: Building a Data Pipeline for ETL Processing

Project Overview: In this project, you will build a data pipeline that extracts data from a source, transforms it, and loads it into a target data store for analytics using various Big Data technologies.

Tools and Technologies:

Hadoop
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services (such as Google Cloud Storage, BigQuery)
HDFS
Hive
Sqoop
Apache Spark
SQL
Project Steps:

Data Source: Choose a sample dataset or source data that you want to work with. For example, you can use public datasets available on GCP or create your own dataset.

Data Extraction (Sqoop): Use Sqoop to extract data from your source (could be a database, CSV file, or any other source) and load it into HDFS or Google Cloud Storage.

Data Transformation (Spark): Write a Spark application (using PySpark or Scala) to perform data transformation on the extracted data. You can do data cleansing, aggregation, or any other required transformations.

Data Processing (Hive): Create Hive tables on top of the transformed data in HDFS or Google Cloud Storage. Write Hive queries to perform data analysis, filtering, or any other analytics tasks.

Data Loading (GCP Services): Load the transformed data into a target data store such as Google BigQuery for further analytics and querying.

Data Visualization and Analysis: Use SQL queries to analyze the data stored in BigQuery and create visualizations using tools like Google Data Studio or any other visualization tool of your choice.

Project Extensions:

Implement data partitioning and bucketing in Hive for optimized query performance.
Schedule the data pipeline to run at regular intervals using Apache Airflow.
Experiment with different data processing techniques in Spark like window functions, UDFs, or MLlib for machine learning tasks.
